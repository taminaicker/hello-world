# hello-world
##My first repository

My name is Tamiel *(Tami)* and I am currently doing a post-graduate data science at Stellenbosch University! I have an undergraduate degree in aeronautical engineering, half of which I completed in Nanjing China (2 years). I completed the other half online (because of the C word), and attended lectures from 2AM-12PM most days >_< !

After graduating, and spending most days at my computer, I started relearning SQL - that I originally learned in high school and I became really interested in what I could do those skills. That's how I ended up transistioning into data science and learning:

*R,Python,Machine Learning,and a ton more!*

I think this is enough info for now :P. 

Bye!
